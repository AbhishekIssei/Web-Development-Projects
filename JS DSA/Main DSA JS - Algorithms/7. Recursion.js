// Recursion

// Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. 
// This technique is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, 
// similar subproblems.

// A recursive function typically has two main components:
// Base Case: The condition under which the function stops calling itself, 
// preventing an infinite loop.
// Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with a modified argument, 
// moving towards the base case.
