// Data Structure
// A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data.

// Characteristics of Data Structures:
// Organization: Data structures provide a way to organize data in a logical and efficient manner.
// Efficiency: They help in optimizing the performance of data operations.
// Storage: They define how data is stored in memory.
// Access: They determine how data can be accessed and manipulated.
// Types of Data Structures

// Types of Data Structures:
// Primitive Data Structures: Basic structures like integers, floats, characters, and pointers.
// Non-Primitive Data Structures: More complex structures that can be divided into:
// Linear Data Structures: Data elements are arranged in a sequential manner. 
// Examples include:
// Arrays
// Linked Lists
// Stacks
// Queues
// Non-Linear Data Structures: Data elements are not in sequence. 
// Examples include:
// Trees
// Graphs
// Hash-based Data Structures: Data is stored in key-value pairs. 
// Examples include:
// Hash Tables
// Maps
